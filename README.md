Welcome to Cat's Shop! This platform reproduces the real shopping experience in the digital environment.
It is an online shopping portal for purebred cats that provides an interactive experience for users.

Our app is powered by CommerceTools, which offers a microservices-based cloud-based commerce platform
that enables brands to create unique and compelling digital commerce experiences!

In our store, users can view a wide range of cat breeds, view detailed descriptions, add a pet to the
cart for further checkout. It includes features such as user registration and login, pet search on
the page, sorting by certain parameters to make the shopping experience more streamlined and convenient.

When the buyer places an order, we immediately get to work and send a notification that the order
has been accepted for work and its transportation is organized. Also, the buyer can track the
geolocation of the transport that carries your pet!

Our delivery method was invented by the founders of the store in the fastest and most comfortable way:
we have organized a special air and ground transport with a service for the treatment and care of your pet:
this includes veterinary supervision, feeding and entertainment. Delivery implemented throughout Europe!
