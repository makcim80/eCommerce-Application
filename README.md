# eCommerce-Application

## Description of the project
eCommerce-Application - this is a team project in which you have to develop your own online store

## Required Skills
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Husky, Jest, ESLint, Prettier
- API
- CommerceTools

## Technical requirements
- TypeScript is used to write application code.
- (Optional) using framework React, Angular, Vue etc.
- Using eslint configured for TypeScript validation.
- It is forbidden to use obsolete libraries (JQuery, etc.)

## Project steps
### Sprint 1: In the first sprint, the team should set up a project repository,
set up project management with a task board, integration with CommerceTools
for project creation and an API client, and set up development environments
with a builder, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier. , Husky and Jest for testing.

#### Working with the Repository
- Create a `develop` branch from the `main` or `master` branch.
- For each task, create a new branch from the `develop` branch, make the changes, and create
a pull request to merge the changes back into the `develop` branch after a code review.
Multiple issues can be combined into a single pull request. 
- At the end of the sprint, create a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `main` or `master`
branch with a description in accordance with the requirements of rs-school.
- Share the pull request link with the mentor for review and evaluation.

#### Stages of the first sprint
1. Repository Setup
- Create a GitHub repository for the project, complete with a README file, .gitignore, and necessary dependencies.
- Set up a clear and organized folder structure within the repository, ensuring a maintainable and scalable codebase
- Invite all team members and the mentor as collaborators, ensuring everyone has access to contribute to the repository.
- Create a pull request template with a clear structure for describing proposed changes and the rationale behind them
2. Task Board Setup (Trello, Jira, etc.)
- Create a project task board using a project management tool (e.g., Trello or Jira), organizing tasks into lists or
columns corresponding to their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
-  Break down project tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks and assign them to team members, ensuring a clear delegation
of responsibilities.
- Share the task board with the team members and the mentor, ensuring everyone can track progress and update the status of their tasks.
3. CommerceTools Project and API Client Setup
- Create the project in CommerceTools, setting up the currencies, languages, and other configurations in the Merchant Center.
- Create the API client for CommerceTools, enabling access to the platform's APIs and managing permissions and scopes required for the project.
4. Development Environment Configuration
- Set up and configure a bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Parcel, or other) for the project, supporting both development and production build modes.
- Configure TypeScript to enforce strong typing and improve code quality throughout the project.
- Set up ESLint to enforce consistent coding styles and identify potential issues in the codebase.
- Configure Prettier to automatically format code, ensuring a consistent and readable code style.
- Initialize Husky to manage Git hooks, automating tasks such as code formatting and linting checks during the commit process.
- Install and configure Jest as the testing framework for the project, enabling comprehensive testing of code functionality.
5. Development Scripts
- Create a script for running ESLint across the codebase, enabling quick and efficient identification of coding style issues and potential errors.
- Create a script for running Prettier across the codebase, simplifying code formatting and ensuring uniform code style.
- Create a script for running Jest tests, streamlining the process of executing tests and generating reports on test outcomes.
6. Comprehensive README
- Add a thorough README file in the repository, describing the project, its purpose, and the technology stack used.
- Clearly document all available scripts (e.g., for running ESLint, Prettier, and Jest tests) and their usage in the README file.
- Provide detailed instructions for setting up and running the project locally, ensuring newcomers and contributors can quickly get started.

### Sprint 2: In the second sprint, the team will focus on implementing the login,
registration and main pages, including input validation, integration with
an authentication service, managing user authentication state, saving the authentication token,
providing buttons to navigate between the login and registration pages,
and implementing routing for proper navigation. The team's progress will be
evaluated through a cross-check process, where other students will assign points based
on achieving specific goals and milestones.

### Sprint 3: In this sprint, the team will focus on implementing the Catalog Product page,
the Detailed Product page, and the User Profile page. This includes fetching and displaying
a list of products with essential details, implementing filtering, sorting, and searching
functionality, designing interactive product cards, and providing navigation between product
categories. All these features should be built using the commercetools API, or any other simple API,
for product data retrieval and management.

For the Detailed Product page, it should provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience by
displaying extensive product information. The page should feature an image slider, a modal window
for enlarged product images, breadcrumb navigation, and widgets for selecting product options.

The User Profile page should present the user's personal information, including their first name,
last name, date of birth, and a list of their addresses. Additionally,
it should provide a user-friendly interface for users to switch to an edit mode,
where they can update their personal details, email, and addresses.

### Sprint 4:
In this sprint, the team will concentrate on enhancing the Detailed Product Page,
building the Basket page, and further enhancing the Catalog page.
These enhancements will include features such as a comprehensive view of a product with
the option to add or remove the product from the cart, increase or decrease the quantity
of the product, and display a clear indicator if the product is already in the user's shopping cart.

The team will also work on features for the Basket page like displaying a list of items added
to the basket, increasing or decreasing the quantity of each item, removing items from the basket,
displaying the subtotal and total prices, and a button for proceeding to the checkout page.

For the Catalog page, we will implement interactive product cards and shopping cart integration.
All these features should be built using the commercetools API for data retrieval and management.
We will also implement performance optimization techniques such as lazy loading, pagination,
or infinite scroll to handle a large number of products efficiently.
